    "text": "Figure 1\n\n\nOftentimes, Mississippi reports as having some of the highest, if not the highest, mortality rate when it comes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (2), many attributable to African Americans (3). In 1998 (4) and in response to the noted disparities, a collaboration between three higher education institutions and the National Institutes of Health, among other funders, established the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). The JHS is a “single-site, prospective, epidemiologic investigation of CVD among African Americans” (2). The area encompasses the tri county area surrounding Jackson, Mississippi. Participants were recruited using criteria outlined in Table 1 from September 2000 - February 2004, with a final cohort size of 5,302.\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\nWhile heart disease has been identified as the leading cause of death, it’s also important to further explore other CVD, such as strokes. According to the CDC (5), 1 in 6 cardiovascular deaths was due to stroke, more than half of stroke survivors age 65+ have a reduction in mobility, and is a significant contributor to “serious long-term disability.” The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) (6) defines a stroke of occurrence as “when the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly interrupted or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, spilling blood into the spaces surrounding brain cells.” As a result, brain cells are deprived of oxygen and nutrients. Strokes are further subcategorized into ischemic, which is the blockage of a blood vessel which brings blood to the brain, or hemorrhagic, when bleeding occurs in or around the brain.\nThere are several factors associated with stroke and are identified as: high, blood pressure, high cholesterol, previous stroke, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, sickle cell disease, family history, age, sex, race/ethnicity. In addition, there are several factors which contribute to stroke including a poor diet, minimal physical activity, excessive alcohol use and tobacco use (7). Of those, the CDC further drills down to identify high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity and diabetes as the major factors contributing to stroke (5). In addition, though age is not a major factor, risk increases with age.\nThe JHS, while not formally a surveillance data set, does possess two major attributes which lend itself towards the classification of surveillance data: annual followup (AFU) and medical record abstraction (MRA) (2). Trained interviewers conduct yearly calls to the cohort to inform annual followup data with a goal of capturing significant health events. These data are entered into the JHS data management system which interacts with MRA unit. In turn, the MRA unit identifies and extracts CVD data (illness and death) which flows to the North Carolina Collaborative Studies Coordinating Center (UNC-CSCC). The JHS Coordinating Center in Jackson, MS and the UNC-CSCC collaboratively manage the surveillance data.\nA valuable part of any disease surveillance system is to analyze and interpret the data collected. Data can be used in a variety of ways including a suggestion of a hypothesis, to note trends, inform or evaluate prevention programs and to determine public health needs moving forward (8). The surveillance system’s purpose and design drive the type of analysis needed and has a broad range of methods that can be used. One method of analysis that considers the collection of data at multiple points in time or throughout the disease process is known as survival analysis, a statistical method to determine the time to an event of interest (9). Survival analysis is frequently used in the medical field and events can be defined as disease recurrence, relapse-free time interval, remission or death. In the design of the analysis, it’s to capture what the event is and the period of observation. Survival data rarely have a normal distribution with the majority of events early and tapering, leading to a skewed distribution making many modeling methods (like those assuming normal distribution) inaccurate (10). Survival analysis has unique characteristics which should be defined:\n\nCensoring – only some individuals experience the event and can arise by:\n\nPatient has not yet experienced the outcome by the end of the study\nPatient is lost to follow-up during the study\nPatient experiences an event that makes additional follow-up impossible\n\nRight censoring – The event occurs beyond the end of the follow-up time/study\nLeft censoring – The event occurred prior to the first follow-up\nInterval censoring – The patients come in and out of observation\nNoninformative censoring – When a patient is lost from follow-up, they are just as likely to have a subsequent event as the remaining study participants\nInformative censoring – Patients withdraw from the study because of a decline in clinical condition or drug toxicity\n\nSurvival analysis looks at two related probability functions referred to as survivor, \\(S(t)\\), the likelihood having not occurred at a specific time, and hazard, \\(h(t)\\) or \\(\\lambda(t)\\), the likelihood of the event occurring at a specific time, which are related probabilities. The three most common methods include: Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots, Logrank tests, which are univariate (only take into account the factor of interest) and Cox proportional hazards model, which is a semi-parametric approach and the most common model used in multivariate survival analysis. Other multivariate analyses are available which take into account multiple variables/factors that might influence the outcome and include two general types of testing groups: proportional hazard approaches (semi-parametric & fully parametric approaches) and accelerated failure time models (11).\nThe KM method is a straightforward model that requires no further explanation of variations in survival time in relation to independent variables (9). Using this method is based on the assumption that all events occur independently of each other (10). This model returns an estimation for each patient surviving at the start of the observation period as a probability of surviving to the end of each observation period. Each probability is a “step function” whose value changes only at each event time. A cumulative survival probability can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of surviving from one interval to the next. The Logrank test compares the survival of two groups as is seen when using a control group. This method assumes no differences between groups and calculates the expected number of events at any given time for both groups (10).\nThe Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) regression model is the most used method to analyze survival data and “describes the relation between the event incident, as expressed by the hazard function and a set of covariates” and no one type of statistical distribution is assumed (10). One reason for its popularity as a model is its close resemblance to other regression models, which explains a dependent (outcome) variable is related to one or more independent variables (9). This method allows for the ability to control for censored cases and their effects, where linear models don’t allow for that.\nIn the JHS study, strokes can be documented in three ways - adjudicated cases, through the annual followup phone interviews and subsequent data or through data collected on forms at formal clinical visits. The focus of this analysis is to focus on adjudicated cases, as defined by the process by which trained medical personnel review the events of the study to confirm and classify the presence and the type of stroke (12)."

The analysis was completed using R statistical software package, specifically the {survival} package. A time variable was created from the date at visit 1 until either the date of event (stroke) or the censoring date to use in the analysis. Using the calculated time and the variable stroke, a survival object was created using the surv function. The object created was then used to construct a survival curve using the survfit function. A Kaplan-Meier plot was then created to visualize the survival curve and confidence interval with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the probability of being stroke free."
